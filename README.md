# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
This will involve a lot of forethought before coding ever begins. Following would be required frequent testing, preferably several different types such as static and dynamic, as well as integration and system testing where required. For assured security I would need to run dependency checks on my program and then address any problems that this may reveal.
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
It starts with understanding what purpose the software is meant to serve. Try to view it from the user's perspective. Only then can you hope to create not just functional but accurate and user-friendly software.
# How do I approach designing software?
I also start with a good design  and thorough questions asked. Before any coding can begin, there must be little to no ambiguity. From there frequent testing is essential, as well as incremental development. Problems can quickly arise and should be solved before they can get out of hand. Of course the finished product should be rigourously tested to assure that it meets the unique needs of the user it is meant to serve.
